Folio
=========
This project used to be hosted at http://ml7.stuycs.org:8888 but is not there any more.
To run the project locally, git clone the repo. Run app.py ("python app.py") and then login. We recommend looking at the music folio that belongs to the user kingofirony ( http://ml7.stuycs.org:8888/kingofirony/Music ). Some functions may no longer work, as the database associated with this project is probably gone.

Features To Be Implemented

###Frontend  (Peter & Elizabeth) 
*   Ready-made templates
*   Upload resume  
*   Allow users to tag projects/bits of information according to the resume they want them to appear in, as well as weight them so they appear in the desired order (i.e. #net: 1, #sysadmin: 7)  
*   Allow users to link to content from other sites   
*   Many more

###Backend  (Sarah & Daryl)
*   Forgotten password server stuff

Deadlines
---------

*    4/1: MongoDB code for storing folios functional.  COMPLETE
*    4/5: Login page should be functional for multiple users concurrently accessing folio. COMPLETE
*    4/7: Users should be able to view and edit folio at a basic level. COMPLETE
*    4/12: Editing folios allows for addition of projects. COMPLETE
*    4/21: Integration with other sites worked out. UNFINISHED
*    4/24: Visual designs added to site and folios.  COMPLETE (not customizable)
*    4/28: Project deployed; testing. Peter and Daryl are out of the picture for the next 4 days so Sarah and Elizabeth will deal with debugging.
*    4/30: Folio is polished; final issues are being worked out.  A few ready-made templates created (pushed back from 4/5 -- this has become more of an "if we have time" thing than an actuality).
*    5/1: Project due date  
*    6/20: Software Development demo night!

Individual Task Distribution
----------------------------
These will change as the project progresses. Feel free to modify anything. 
*   Peter will lead frontend work.
*   Sarah will lead backend work.
*   Peter and Elizabeth are to finalize the UI design, paper prototyping everything and beginning to work on the html pages. Once a solid UI design is in place, there will be many more tasks here.  
*   Sarah will write the server code for the login page, implementing session for login (and etc)
*   Daryl will plan out visual effect templates for use towards the end of the project, delegate and coordinate work, and perform general bugfixes/pitch in wherever he sees fit.
*   Team leader is unfilled. It is either Sarah or Daryl, we're not sure at the moment.

Branch Workflow/Github Use
--------------------------
Not quite established yet but have a [Git Cheat Sheet](http://byte.kde.org/~zrusin/git/git-cheat-sheet-medium.png).

Everyone will probably work on their own branches, merging when necessary and using pull requests to meddle with master.
